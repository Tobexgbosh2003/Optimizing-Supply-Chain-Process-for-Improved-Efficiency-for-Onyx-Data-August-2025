By implementing the following recommended actions, the company can optimize its supply chain, improve customer satisfaction, and drive revenue growth:

Products with more sales should always be in stock to boost revenue.

Locations with lower sales and revenue may require localized marketing or distribution strategies.

Explore alternative suppliers to reduce reliance on Supplier 1.

Prioritize timely deliveries to improve customer satisfaction.

Optimize delivery routes and prioritize Carrier C to minimize transportation costs and delivery time.

Implement quality improvement initiatives like waste management to reduce defect rates.
